    The SAP Calculator is an analysis tool that allows you to easily calculate the approximate odds of your team beating another team.
    The SAP Calculator simulates the defined battle 1000 times and determines the percentage of wins, draws and loses.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Disclaimer: The SAP Calculator is not an official tool of the game and is not affiliated with the game's developers. The SAP Calculator is a fan-made tool,
    and is not intended to replace the official game.</b>
</p>

<p>
    The SAP Calculator engine is based on the official game engine, but it may not be 100% accurate. It is pretty darn close though, and should be 
    completely accurate for nearly every possible battle.
